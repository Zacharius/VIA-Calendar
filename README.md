An event aggregater, allows you to see whats going on around San Antonio.

The website can be found at https://eventnear.us

This is an ongoing project by several developers to make a fully featured event website that allows you to search, interact, and receive content in interesting and intuitive ways. Our hope with this project is to better learn and practice our UI and engineering skills, get exposed to new technologies/frameworks, and to provide a tool that will be valuable to our community.
