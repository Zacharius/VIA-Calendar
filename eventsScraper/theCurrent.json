An annual program that\u2019s successfully built bridges between San Antonio artists and curators from Dallas, Houston, Mexico City, New Orleans and Miami \u2014\u00a0and also generated significant controversy in 2016 with an all-female show ultimately canceled for its failure to include a Latina artist \u2014 the CAM Perennial partners with Artpace this year to welcome Spain into the fold with a group exhibition curated by Canary Islands-based Adonay Berm\u00fadez. A presence in San Antonio since 1731 \u2014\u00a0when 16 immigrant families arrived here armed with a decree from the King of Spain \u2014\u00a0Canary Islanders helped establish the first organized civil government in Texas, the villa of San Fernando de B\u00e9xar. A socially minded curator who often addresses the \u201cdemocratization of art\u201d as well as the \u201cdisturbances, fears and interests\u201d of contemporary society, Berm\u00fadez paired Canary Islands artists Luna Bengoechea, Francis Naranjo and PSJM (aka Cynthia Viera and Pablo San Jos\u00e9) with San Antonio-based Hayfer Brea (born in Caracas, Venezuela), Barbara Mi\u00f1arro (born in Monterrey, Mexico) and Ethel Shipton (born in Laredo). Following its run in Artpace\u2019s Hudson Showroom, the CAM Perennial will travel to an art space in the Canary Islands. A renowned program that helped place San Antonio\u2019s art scene in a global context, Artpace\u2019s International Artist-in-Residence series welcomes a trio of artists (one from Texas, one from elsewhere in the U.S. and one from abroad) three times each year \u201cto live and create art in San Antonio for two months.\u201d Organized by independent curator and critic Risa Puleo, the Spring 2018 edition comprises site-specific exhibitions created by Carlos Rosales-Silva (Austin), Rafa Esparza (Los Angeles) and Kapwani Kiwanga (Paris). With previous projects exploring colors and forms \u201cthat have long been (ab)used to create oppressive stereotypes of Mexican and Indigenous peoples\u201d (Rosales-Silva), colonization and \u201cdisrupted genealogies\u201d (Esparza), anthropology, religion and Afrofuturism (Kiwanga), the trio appears bound less by aesthetics than academic research and social concerns. Already on view in Artpace\u2019s street-level Main Space, San Antonio-based Corpus Christi native John Medina\u2019s evolving installation \u201cThe Sunset Belongs to Us\u201d reaches its second phase as amplified recordings of participants sharing Alamo City stories get placed in the context of a large-scale drip painting inspired by the San Antonio sunset.", "sourceLink": "http://contemporaryartmonth.com/event/contemporary-art-month-perennial-exhibition-2018/?instance_id=480"},
