To Do:
1) Two data sources - automatic. Scraper pick up new events and push to the database. 
2) http does not redirect to https
3) better documentation, readme page on github
4) Start running tests
5) Basic monitoring, usage statistics; no cookie trackers

(farther down the road)

6) Feature: allow users subscribe to venue artists - event feeds can be accessed on our site or can get an rss feed.
7) API for adding events. 

8) problem with mobile features. 

9) need to set up multiple filters
10) allow filters and search
11) http get parameters fix
